## Numgle for php

First install php and composer into your PC(or server)  to use this program.  
And comment out extension=mbstring in php.ini because of UTF8 support(mb_str, mb_ord etc...)  

Finally type below command
````
php artisan serve
````



This project is not complete.  
I need your help.
